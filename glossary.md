Light is a wave
Sound is a wave

Huygens' princible: You can predict a wave's position in the future by analyzing its current position. 

r = vt
r = distance traveled 
v = velocity 
t = time

Light is photons

Photon - smallest quantity of energy that can be transported. An elementary particle without a real size.
Cannot be split. Only created and destroyed. 

Electromagnetic radiation. 8 types of waves. Visible light spectrum is ultravoilet light. 

Gamma is smallest. Highest energy photons.
Photons travel at 'c' the speed of light just at different frequencies 

visible light is the only group that propagates well in water. - why we evolved to see it.

Sound waves are mechanical waves that require a medium, such as air or water, to propagate. They involve the motion of matter through compressions and rarefactions, generating sound by transmitting energy. 

Light waves are electromagnetic waves that do not require a medium to propagate. They consist of oscillating electric and magnetic fields, perpendicular to each other and the direction of propagation, creating light by transmitting energy across the electromagnetic spectrum.
