Light is a wave
Sound is a wave

Huygens' princible: You can predict a wave's position in the future by analyzing its current position. 

r = vt
r = distance traveled 
v = velocity 
t = time

wavelets
diffraction pattern

i = intensity 

frequency 
wavelength 
velocity 

Light is photons

Photon - smallest quantity of energy that can be transported. An elementary particle without a real size.
Cannot be split. Only created and destroyed. 

Electromagnetic radiation. 8 types of waves. Visible light spectrum is ultravoilet light. 

Gamma is smallest. Highest energy photons.
Photons travel at 'c' the speed of light just at different frequencies 

visible light is the only group that propagates well in water. - why we evolved to see it.
